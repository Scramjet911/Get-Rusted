### First wasm with rust and js
Run server using `python -m http.server` to see the js alert

### Calculator and game of life
Build rust to wasm using `wasm-pack build --target web` then run react server using `npm start`.

#### Disclaimer
- This is a Rust learning series so the web code is not clean...
