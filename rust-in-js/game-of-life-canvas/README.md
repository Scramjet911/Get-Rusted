### Guide:
Followed the rust wasm tutorial [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/implementing.html)

### Issues faced
- Accessing memory of rust from js was problematic. I had to await for the result from `initPkg` function and use that instead of the method used in the tutorial.

Now the tutorial is over. Going to be making my own stuff. 
Next I am going to try my hand on image processing...
